## Create a new docs Pull Request (PR)
Contributing to open source involves actively participating in a project by proposing changes such as code enhancements, test modifications, documentation updates, or addressing minor issues like typos and broken links. This section will guide you through creating and submitting a pull request.

- A Docsâ€™ PR should solve one documentation problem. 
- Remember to first open a docs issue before creating a PR if there is no current issue for the docs task you want to accomplish. 
- Use the [conventional commit style](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits) when creating PRs. Always create a docs issue or PR with the `docs:` prefix in the title. 
- Check your contribution and ensure it follows the AsyncAPI style guide.
- Tag other technical writers to review the document. 
- Tag an engineer or subject matter expert (SME) to review the technical details.
- After implementing all requested feedback, update your PR and wait for further feedback or a merge.
