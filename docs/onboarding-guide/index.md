## AsyncAPI docs onboarding Guide
This section is a guide for new technical writers rather than a comprehensive reference manual detailing specific rules for contributing to AsyncAPI documentation. Please refer to the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more about how you can contribute.

This section provides onboarding guides for new technical writers who join the AsyncAPI community. This onboarding guide aims to help technical writers:
- Understand tools, technologies, and processes in our docs.
- Understand consumers of the documentation.
- Identify teammates and SMEs (Subject matter experts).
- Make changes to the documentation.
- Receive feedback from the reviewer.
- Find bugs and create issues.
- Publish changes.
